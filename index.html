                 <h2>Squads for each Competition 24/25</h2>
                 <h3>UEFA Champions League</h3>
            </header>
            <main>
                <p>The Reds return to the competition in 2024-25 and will be part of a revamped format that sees 36 teams each playing eight different opponents during the opening stage.</p>
                <p>Arne Slot’s men are set to host Bologna, Bayer Leverkusen, Real Madrid and Lille at Anfield, while also travelling to face AC Milan, RB Leipzig, Girona and PSV Eindhoven.</p>
                <p>Ahead of their first league phase fixture, at AC Milan on September 17, the following squad has been submitted to UEFA by the club.</p>
                <h3>Player List A</h3>
                <p>Alexander-Arnold, Alisson, Chiesa, Diaz, Endo, Gakpo, Gomez, Gravenberch, Hill, Jaros, Jones, Jota, Kelleher, Konate, Mac Allister, Morton, Nallo, Nunez, Nyoni, Robertson, Salah, Szoboszlai, Tsimikas, Van Dijk.</p>
                <p>Teams can name a maximum of 25 players on List A, including a minimum of eight places reserved exclusively for ‘locally trained players’.</p>
                <p>Several members of the Reds’ senior squad – including Conor Bradley, Harvey Elliott and Jarell Quansah – are eligible but do not need to be included on List A due to their ages and club-trained status.</p>
                <p>They can instead be named to List B, on which clubs can register an unlimited number of players during the season and update before each fixture.</p>
                <p>UEFA’s regulations state: “A player may be registered on List B if he is born on or after 1 January 2003 and has, since his 15th birthday, been eligible to play for the club concerned for any uninterrupted period of two years, or a total of three consecutive years with a maximum of one loan period to a club from the same association for a period not longer than one year.</p>
                <p>“Players aged 16 may be registered on List B if they have been registered with the participating club for the previous two years without interruption.”</p>
                <p>Teams who progress to the Champions League knockout rounds are permitted to update List A with three new eligible players – while keeping the squad total to a maximum of 25 – by February 6, 2025.</p>
